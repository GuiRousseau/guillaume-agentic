# Developer Agent Rules

## Package Manager Rules

### Rule: Detect and Use Bun When Available
- **Requirement**: Agent detects project package manager preference and uses appropriate commands
- **Detection Method**:
  - Check for `bun.lockb` (Bun lockfile) - indicates Bun project
  - Check for `bunfig.toml` (Bun configuration) - indicates Bun project
  - Check for `package-lock.json` (npm lockfile) - indicates npm project
  - Default to npm if no indicator found
- **Bun Advantages**: Faster installs, built-in bundler, better performance
- **When to Use**:
  - Use Bun for new React projects (recommended)
  - Use npm for existing projects that already use npm
  - Always respect project's existing lock file
- **Commands**:
  - **Bun**: `bun install`, `bun run test`, `bun run build`
  - **npm**: `npm install`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`

### Rule: React Framework Preference
- **Requirement**: Agent specializes in React development
- **Supported Frameworks**:
  - React 18+ (default)
  - Next.js (App Router preferred, Pages Router supported)
- **TypeScript**: Always use TypeScript for new components
- **Package Manager Context**: Pass detected package manager to all skills

## Component Creation Rules

### Rule: Every Component Must Have a Test File
- **Requirement**: For every React component created, a corresponding test file must be generated simultaneously
- **Format**: Component name `Button.tsx` → Test file `Button.test.tsx`
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% code coverage per component
- **Scope**: Applies to all new components, refactored components, and component rewrites

### Rule: Readable Code Structure First
- **Requirement**: Prioritize code readability and maintainability over performance micro-optimizations
- **Guidelines**:
  - Function length should not exceed 50 lines; break complex logic into smaller functions
  - Variable names must be descriptive (no single letters except loop indices)
  - Complex logic must include explanatory comments
  - Props interfaces must be well-documented with JSDoc

### Rule: Descriptive Naming Conventions
- **Requirement**: All identifiers follow clear naming patterns
- **Component Names**: PascalCase, descriptive adjectives + noun (e.g., `UserProfileCard`, `ErrorBoundary`)
- **Function Names**: camelCase, verb + object (e.g., `fetchUserData`, `handleSubmit`)
- **Variable Names**: camelCase, noun-based, self-documenting (e.g., `isLoading`, `userEmail`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)

## Testing Requirements

### Rule: Test-Driven Component Creation
- **Requirement**: Tests should be created alongside or before components
- **Test Structure**:
  - One `describe` block per component or feature
  - One `it`/`test` block per behavior or scenario
  - Separate test files for integration and unit tests
  - Use clear, human-readable test descriptions

### Rule: Comprehensive Test Scenarios
- **Requirement**: Test files must cover all major code paths and user interactions
- **Minimum Coverage Areas**:
  - Component renders without errors
  - Props are handled correctly (valid and invalid)
  - User interactions trigger expected behaviors
  - Error states and edge cases
  - Conditional rendering branches
- **Tools**: Jest + React Testing Library (prioritize user-centric queries over implementation details)

### Rule: Test File Documentation
- **Requirement**: Test files are part of documentation
- **Guidelines**:
  - Test names describe the expected behavior (e.g., `it('displays loading spinner while fetching data')`)
  - Complex test setups include explanatory comments
  - Mock data is clearly documented
  - Assertions explain what behavior is being verified

## Readability Standards

### Rule: Code Documentation
- **Requirement**: Complex components must include JSDoc blocks
- **Guidelines**:
  - JSDoc for all exported functions and components
  - Parameter descriptions and return types
  - Example usage for complex components
  - Explanation of non-obvious logic

### Rule: File Organization
- **Requirement**: Components and related code are organized logically
- **Structure**:
  ```
  src/components/
    ├── Button/
    │   ├── Button.tsx       (component)
    │   ├── Button.test.tsx  (tests)
    │   ├── Button.styles.ts (styles, if applicable)
    │   └── index.ts         (export)
    └── ...
  ```
- **One Responsibility Per File**: Each file has a single, clear purpose

### Rule: Avoid Performance Premature Optimization
- **Requirement**: Do NOT optimize for performance unless there is a documented performance problem
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use straightforward algorithms over complex "optimized" ones
  - Avoid premature memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`) without profiling
  - Use readable loops over obscure functional patterns
  - Err on the side of clarity in conditional logic
- **Exception**: Performance optimizations are allowed only when:
  - A performance issue is identified and measured
  - The optimization is documented with a comment explaining why
  - Tests confirm the optimization doesn't break functionality

## Refactoring Rules

### Rule: Maintain Test Coverage During Refactoring
- **Requirement**: Test files must be updated and coverage must be maintained during refactoring
- **Process**:
  1. Ensure all tests pass before refactoring
  2. Refactor code incrementally
  3. Run tests after each small change
  4. Update tests if behavior changes
  5. Never reduce test coverage

### Rule: Improve Readability in Refactoring
- **Requirement**: Use refactoring as an opportunity to improve readability
- **Actions**:
  - Extract magic numbers into named constants
  - Break long functions into smaller, named functions
  - Add explanatory comments for complex logic
  - Improve variable and function names

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [ ] No premature optimizations without performance profiling
- [ ] Component props are documented with JSDoc

## Package.json Configuration Examples

### With Bun
```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --watch src/index.tsx",
    "build": "bun build ./src/index.tsx --outdir ./dist",
    "test": "bun test",
    "test:watch": "bun test --watch",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

### With npm
```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
    "jest": "^29.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "vite": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Example: Compliant Component

```typescript
/**
 * UserCard component
 *
 * Displays user profile information with an edit button.
 * Emits callback when user clicks edit.
 *
 * @example
 * <UserCard user={userData} onEdit={handleEdit} />
 */
export interface UserCardProps {
  /** User data to display */
  user: User;
  /** Callback when edit button is clicked */
  onEdit: (userId: string) => void;
}

export const UserCard: React.FC<UserCardProps> = ({ user, onEdit }) => {
  const handleEditClick = () => {
    onEdit(user.id);
  };

  return (
    <article className="user-card">
      <header>
        <img src={user.avatarUrl} alt={user.name} />
        <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      </header>
      <section className="stats">
        <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
        <p>Joined: {formatDate(user.joinedAt)}</p>
      </section>
      <button onClick={handleEditClick}>Edit Profile</button>
    </article>
  );
};
```

Corresponding test file would verify:
1. User information renders correctly
2. Edit button is clickable
3. Callback is called with correct user ID
4. Image alt text matches user name
5. Invalid user data is handled gracefully
